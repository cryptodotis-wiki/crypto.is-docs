### Contribute Servers, Shares and Bandwidth

One of the best ways to help out anonymity projects is to set up and run a
server yourself. The Crypto Projects aims to create a master set of tutorials
and guides for all who are looking to set up servers. Check out [Contributing
Goods][3] to find links to more information on how you can help.
