# Code Clearing House

There's an awful lot of privacy, pseudonymity, anonymity, and crypto projects out there.  While we writing a in-depth review and guide for every one would be an intractable problem - we do hope to provide a directory, a brief overview, links to more resources, and if we can, more information about them.


## Pending Pickup

Projects that have been abandoned or need help - from us or others.

### [FireGPG](http://getfiregpg.org/s/home)

> FireGPG is a Firefox extension under MPL that provides an integrated interface to apply GnuPG operations to the text of any web page, including encryption, decryption, signing, and signature verification.

### [FireOTR](https://www.gitorious.org/fireotr/fireotr)

From the [original announcement](http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.security.otr.devel/1161):

>     I've started to write an add-on for Firefox that uses OTR to ensure
>     encryption on web-based chats.
> 
>     I'm using jsctypes[0] to use the C libotr library from javascript. The
>     incomplete wrapping is in otr_wrapper.js.
>    
>     The code is in a very early stage, some part must be rewritten and there
>     isn't UI, but if you want to take a look you can download it from git:
> 
>     git://gitorious.org/fireotr/fireotr.git
> 
>     For now "works" only for facebook.
