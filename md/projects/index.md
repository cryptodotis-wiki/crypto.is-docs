# Projects

Crypto.is has begun work on a few things it calls projects:

### Code Audit Feed

Writing secure code is hard. But if everyone is intimidated by the prospect,
no secure code would be written. The Code Audit Feed seeks to be a single feed
of commits to crypto and anonyminity tools. It is the hope that an easy to
skim feed of changes will encourage people to watch projects for changes
relating to their area of expertise so they can audit and prehaps become
involved in the project.

### Intro to Crypto

These series of articles aim to show the layperson what benefits using
cryptography and anonyminity software can provide them, how to install and use
the software, and finally how to give back to the community by running
services of their own.

### Code Clearing House

It can be a wide internet out there. This project aims to group security and
anonyminity software, provide an overview of what it does and doesn't provide,
and links to further resources.

### Bleeding Edge

This area is meant to be a testbed of bleeding edge technologies like Strict
Transport Security. While not a comprehensive walkthrough - we hope to provide
enough information for experienced sysadmins to set up bleeding edge features,
as well as link to existing implementations.
