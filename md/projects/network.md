# The Network

One of the main goals of The Crypto Project is to build a large network of anonymity, privacy, and censorship circumvention services. This includes servers and services under the crypto.is domain name as well as those that are run by members of The Crypto Project.

## Services Under *.crypto.is

### Tor

*TorProject.org Mirror*: We run a mirror of the torproject.org website at [https://torproject.crypto.is](https://torproject.crypto.is).
*Tor Relay - "cryptodotis"*: We run a Tor relay with the nickname "cryptodotis".

### Tahoe-LAFS

We currently run a private, test grid with Tahoe-LAFS.  Soon, it will be converted to be run over the Tor network.  Once we have all the bugs ironed out and can properly control access, we will then start to open it up to the public and/or to those in need.

### Convergence

*Notary*: We run a notary at convergence.crypto.is that is open for use.  You can download our [convergence.notary file](http://crypto.is/static/files/cryptodotis.notary) to use our notary.

### Mixminion

*Mixminion Relay - "cryptodotis"*: We run a Mixminion relay that goes by the nickname "cryptodotis".
