# Introduction to Anonymity
The concept of anonymity seems pretty simple: other people not knowing who you are. The problem is that it's not possible for you to interact with something and the person/service/etc not know some kind of identifying information about you. The key to anonymity is in managing what pieces of identifying information you share while you're interacting; managing the difficulty of piecing together everything about your identity from those parts you divulge. A couple simple examples will help to really understand this principle. We'll use Bob and Alice because they're tradition and you'd might as well get to know them now.

Goal: Bob wants to speak to Alice without Alice knowing who's talking to her.

1) Bob walks up to Alice and says "my name's Tim ..."<br>
 - Obviously this isn't going to provide Bob any anonymity, he's shared his appearance, mannerisms - everything but his name.

2) Bob hides in the bushes until Alice walks by and says "Alice! ..."<br>
 - Alice will still easily be able to recognize the sound of Bob's voice and then piece together who's talking to her from behind the bushes.

3) Bob goes home, fires up his voice synthesizer, calls Alice, and robotically says "Hello, Alice ..."<br>
 - Alice will still recognize Bob's home number and, even though she can't recognize his voice, she'll know who it is.

4) Bob finds a random pay-phone (hah, good luck with that), calls Alice with his voice synthesizer, and says "I'd like to speak to an Alice ..."<br>
 - Bob has taken care to guard enough of his identity so that he will be able to communicate anonymously with Alice. Alice still knows someone is communicating with her (and will quickly identify mannerisms, speech patterns, and the like) but piecing that all back to Bob will now be **more difficult than it's worth**.

And there it is: Anonymity is the art of hiding enough of one's identity such that it is more difficult for someone to fully identify you than doing so is worth to that individual.

# Achieving Anonymity
Preparation is the key to any effective anonymity. At the bare minimum, you need to determine the following:<br>
1) Precisely which interaction(s) you wish to participate in.<br>
2) The types of identifying information necessary to do so.<br>
3) Whether consistent and/or repeated interaction is necessary to accomplish your goals.<br>
4) What resources are available to those you wish to remain anonymous from.

# Types of Interactions
Include:

* e-mail
* chatting (live text exchange)
* speaking (voice-to-voice)
* bulk information sharing (file transfer)

# Types of Identifying Information
This isn't even remotely close to an exhaustive list, rely on it as such at your own risk.

* address (building, e-mail, IP)
* location (GPS, wifi-network, ISP)
* mannerisms (emotes, sentence structure, common phrasing)
* watermarking (stains, stenographic information, peculiarities)
* contacts (who/what is interacted with)
* timing (time of day, period after X, perfectly random)
 
#Consistent and Repeated Interaction
Don't. No, seriously, **don't**.

Even if the situation appears to require it (say, chatting in the crypto IRC channel), there generally isn't a compelling reason for consistent and repeated interaction under the same identity. Expanding on the IRC channel example: if you've a question, create a new identity, ask the question, leave, and burn the identity.

The most common reason people believe consistent and repeated interaction is "necessary" is a psychological one: we all want recognition for our efforts. Only you can know whether recognition is more important to you than anonymity. They are, however, perfectly incompatible and you should never be under any illusion otherwise.

#Anonymous from Who
There are two common pitfalls when attempting to prepare for anonymity: hubris and paranoia.

Paranoia may initially seem like a good thing; seem like it will help you to be "even more careful" to ensure your anonymity. The reality is quite the opposite. There are three good reasons for this. First, because you will be performing your interactions in an altered mental state, focused exclusively on your preconceived notions about anonymity, and incapable of acting rationally should any of those preconceived notions be challenged.

Second, you will over-prepare. This might initially sound like a good thing but what is really happening is that you are violating the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle. When you try to defend yourself from shadows at every conceivable corner, you're guaranteed to miss at least some of the actual risks. Your preparation should focus on keeping things as simple as possible. Simple is anonymous, no matter what your paranoid self says.

Third, paranoia inexorably transitions to hubris. Hubris, in this case, is the idea that you have, or even can, "win" somehow. That you've "defeated" whomever's attempting to remove your anonymity, or that you are so incredibly skilled they wouldn't even know where to start. You can not "win", it is impossible to defeat someone's attempts to remove your anonymity, and there are always plenty of places for them to start. So why even bother?

You might be able to get them to quit trying. To do so though, you're going to need to honestly evaluate who "they" actually are. In particular, how much time and effort would "they" be willing to spend attempting to remove your anonymity. And finally: are you willing to spend the quantity of your time and resources necessary to exhaust theirs? If so, we're here to help you learn how.
